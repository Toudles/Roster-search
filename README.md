You've been hired by NYU's Computer Science department to create a tool that will allow professors to look up their course rosters online. Currently course registration data is stored using two different text files.

Your task is to write a program that asks the user for a course ID. The program will then determine if the course ID is valid or not -- if it is not, the program can safely end. If it is valid, the program should report the full title of the course, how many students are enrolled in the course and the names of each student enrolled.

You cannot hard code your program to only work with the values contained within these files. When we test your work we will be using completely different data files that are organized in the same way as these sample files. Your program should work flawlessly using this new data.
